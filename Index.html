<h3>Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tailwind Traders is a mid-size company in the trading space.</li>
  <li>You are the Identity and Access Management administrator.</li>
  <li>The company wants to leverage the power of the cloud.</li>
  <li>Integration with cloud applications will be done using Azure AD.</li>

<p>Before migrating to the cloud, your IT director has requested some prerequisites to be met before provisioning users and groups in the cloud.</p>

<p>As part of the migration, the solutions architect has asked you to move the users to the cloud and take advantage of cloud benefits.</p>

<p>Your Identity administrator is looking for a solution to easily sync users to the cloud with minimal administrative overhead. The solution should also allow easy authentication management even if the on-premises Active Directory is unavailable. Sign-in and disaster recovery reports are also required.</p>

<p>Your business analyst needs recommendations on the license type to assign to users to perform tasks such as access certifications and reviews, entitlements management, and Privileged Identity Management (PIM) with minimum cost.</p>

<p>Your security team has requested the creation of specific groups to address organizational needs, such as a group for global admins, a marketing team collaboration group, an automatic group for sales department users, and device management groups.</p>

<p>As an Identity administrator, you need to ensure SSO is configured, users can reset their passwords in the cloud, and you need to explore different authentication options.</p>
